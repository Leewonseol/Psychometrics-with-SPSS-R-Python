## Ì≥ñ Overview

The purpose of this study is to develop a Scenario Therapy Program and verify its effects on individuals who have experienced PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder).

Considering that scenario writing is specialized in creating specific scenes, this study utilizes the "making specific scenes" aspect of scenario writing to help subjects expose and face their traumatic experiences.

## Key Variables

The study verifies the effect of Scenario Therapy on the following variables:

- **Depression**
- **Emotional Wellbeing**
- **Posttraumatic Growth (PTG)**

## Ì∂ºÔ∏è Research Models & Figures

This section details the development process, structural models, and experimental design used in this study (Figures 1-4).

### 1. Program Development Procedure (Figure 1)

The program was developed following a systematic 5-step procedure based on the Kim Chang-dae (2011) model<sup>1</sup>.

1. **Step 1: Planning** (Goal setting, Literature review, Needs assessment via Screenwriter FGI)
2. **Step 2: Designing** (Goal establishment, Model development, Session structuring)
3. **Step 3: Devising** (Content selection, Pilot study, Expert consultation)
4. **Step 4: Conducting** (Implementation of the final program)
5. **Step 5: Evaluating** (Effectiveness verification, Data analysis)

### 2. Scenario Therapy Program Model (Figure 2)

The therapy model is structured to guide the participant from trauma to psychological growth through 6 stages<sup>2</sup>.

```
Trauma Experience ‚Üí 1. Meeting ‚Üí 2. Exposure ‚Üí 3. Positive Rumination 
‚Üí 4. Emotional Re-experience ‚Üí 5. Ending (Re-writing) ‚Üí 6. New Possibility 
‚Üí Psychological Growth
```

### 3. Reflection of Components (Figure 3)

Key therapeutic components derived from literature and expert interviews were mapped to specific program stages<sup>3</sup>.

| Program Stage | Key Components | Session |
|--------------|----------------|---------|
| Meeting | Orientation, Trust building | Session 1 |
| Exposure | Facing trauma, Objectification | Session 2, 3 |
| Positive Rumination | Intentional rumination, Cognitive reframing | Session 4 |
| Emotional Re-experience | Catharsis, Dramatic reenactment | Session 5, 6 |
| Ending (Writing) | Creating alternatives, Future hope | Session 7, 8 |
| New Possibility | Social support, Self-affirmation | Session 9 |

### 4. Experimental Design (Figure 4)

This study used a Nonequivalent Control Group Pretest-Posttest Design<sup>4</sup>.

- **Experimental Group (n=10):** Pre-test (O‚ÇÅ) ‚Üí Scenario Therapy (X‚ÇÅ) ‚Üí Post-test (O‚ÇÇ) ‚Üí Follow-up (O‚ÇÉ)
- **Control Group (n=10):** Pre-test (O‚ÇÑ) ‚Üí (No Treatment) ‚Üí Post-test (O‚ÇÖ) ‚Üí Follow-up (O‚ÇÜ)

## Ì≥ä Key Findings (Visualized Results)

The following figures illustrate the statistical changes in key variables across three time points: Pre-test, Post-test, and Follow-up (4 weeks later).

### Ì≥â Figure 5: Changes in Depression Scores <sup>5</sup>

- **Experimental Group:** Showed a sharp decrease in depression scores immediately after the program (Post), which was maintained at the Follow-up.
- **Control Group:** Showed no significant change, remaining at a high level of depression.
- **Result:** Significant interaction effect found (*p* < .001).

### Ì≥à Figure 6: Changes in Emotional Wellbeing Scores <sup>6</sup>

- **Experimental Group:** Showed a significant increase in emotional wellbeing scores at Post-test, maintaining the improved level at Follow-up.
- **Control Group:** Remained relatively stable with low scores.
- **Result:** Significant interaction effect found (*p* < .001).

### Ì∫Ä Figure 7: Changes in Posttraumatic Growth (PTG) Scores <sup>7</sup>

- **Experimental Group:** Showed a dramatic increase in PTG scores after the program.
- **Control Group:** Showed little to no change.
- **Result:** Significant interaction effect found (*p* < .001).

## Ì≤° Conclusion

These results suggest that the Scenario Therapy Program is an effective intervention. It helps PTSD-experienced individuals overcome their psychological trauma through exposure and scene reconstruction, ultimately leading them to posttraumatic growth.
